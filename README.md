# STRINGS

### What is a string?

A string *(str)* is a data type represents a sequence of characters in Python. They start with
quotations: ("") , (''), ("""), or (''')

The following are examples of valid strings: 
"hello" || "2.0" || 'str' || \"""False\""" || \'''true\''' || "Wow the moon is so bright tonight!"

### Escape Characters
**The New Line Character**: <sub>\n</sub> is an invisible character that tells the computer to move the cursor to the next line in the console.

*<sub>Invisible meaning, the computer ignores it besides it function to move the cursor to the next line.</sub>*

For Example:
```
print("hello\nworld\n!")

    returns: hello
             world
             !
```

**Backslash** ( \\ )
Backslash: used to escape itself or other characters
```
Example of \\ escape character
```

**Single Quotes** ( \' )
Single Quotes: used to represent a single quotes.
```
Example of \' escape character
```

**Double Quotes** ( \" )
Double quote (used to represent a double quote)
```
pass
```

**Tab** ( \t )
Tab: used as a tab in a string
```
Pass
```

**Carriage Return** ( \r	)
Carriage return: (used to return to the beginning of the line)
```
pass
```

**Backspace** ( \b	)
Backspace: (used to move the cursor one position backward)
```
pass
```

You can use these escape characters in Python strings to represent special characters or characters that cannot be directly included in the string. For example, "\n" represents a newline character, and "\t" represents a tab character.

There are several other escape characters such as:
- \f
- \v
- \ooo
- \xhh
- \uhhhh
- \uhhhhhhhh
I didn't write them all here because they are less used. However, I want to help educate as much as I can so knowing they exist is probably good. If you are so inclined, feel free to look them up.


### String Methods

### upper() lower() title() capitalize()
```
name = "Kam"
print(name.upper())      # KAM
print(name.lower())      # kam
print(name.capitalize()) # Kam
print(name.title())      # Kam

# The difference between .capitalize() and .title() methods in Python is that they are both used to capitalize strings, but they do so in different ways.
# The title() method capitalizes the first letter of every word in the string.
# The capitalize() method only capitalizes the first letter of the first word in the string.

str = "The moon is beautiful tonight!"
print(str.capitalize())  # The moon is beautiful tonight!
print(str.title())       # The Moon Is Beautiful Tonight!
```


### .split()
.split() separates your string into an array using a **delimiter** to separate the words.

    <sub> - A delimiter is the character that tells you how to separate the string, (",") , ("."), (" ")</sub>
    <sub> - when you put nothing, it defaults to spaces. (" ")</sub>

**.split() Parameter Values**
separator:	        (Optional.) Specifies the separator to use when splitting the string. By default any whitespace is a separator
maxsplit:	        (Optional.) Specifies how many splits to do. Default value is -1, which is "all occurrences"
<sub>When maxsplit is specified, the list will contain the specified number of elements plus one.</sub>

```
sentence = "The International Space Station is in dire need!"

lst = sentence.split()
print(lst) # ["The", "International", "Space", "Station", "is", "in", "dire", "need!"]

# by default, since no second, optional, parameter was added, it defaulted to the delimiter of a " " (space)

                                        ----------
                                        
sentence = "Hello, this is captain Berk of the ISS, we have a grave status report."
lst = sentence.split(", ")
print(lst) # ["Hello", "this is captain Berk of the ISS", "we have a grave status report."]

# in this example the original sentence is broken into an array based on the separator parameter we specified above. In this case: (", ")

                                        ----------
                                        
sentence = "Moments after the ISS emergency broadcast. Looking up, you can see that the moon has been shattered and is now falling towards the Earth. Tweet #alieninvasion, #resistthem, or #moonshattering to spread awareness."
lst = sentence.split("#", 1)
print(lst) # ['Moments after the ISS emergency broadcast. Looking up, you can see that the moon has been shattered and is now falling towards the Earth. Tweet ', 'alieninvasion, #resistthem, or #moonshattering to spread awareness.']

# in this final example, the original sentence will be split by the (#) marking, but it will only be split by the second parameter, maxsplit, times. Which in this case is 1 time.
```

### .replace()
.replace() method replaces a specified phrase with another specified phrase.
- It replaces all of the characters in a current string with whatever string you specify.
- Then it will return a NEW string with all of the replaced characters.
(string.replace(oldvalue, newvalue, count))


**.split() Parameter Values**
old value:	        (Required.) The string to search for
new value:	        (Required.) The string to replace the old value with
count:	            (Optional.) A number specifying how many occurrences of the old value you want to replace. Default is all occurrences
<sub>All occurrences of the specified phrase will be replaced, if nothing else is specified.</sub>

```
s = "A,B,C,D"
s2 = s.replace("," , "|") # will return "A|B|C|D"
# s.replace() doesn't change the original variable. Instead it creates a new variable. So you might have trouble when using .replace() without assigning the returned value to a new variable.
```


```
.join() # used to build a new string from an iterable item (set, dictionary, list)
lst = ["d","a", "n"]
lst_string = "".join(lst) #takes all the items in the iterable together into the variable.
lst.string = "-".join(lst) # returns "d-a-n"
lst.string = "|".join(lst) # returns "d|a|n"
```


# F-Strings
# to help with the cumbersome nature of concatenation
# {can but any equation in here or variable name if it exists}
# You are a human on Earth who is receiving intel from Potsu about the aliens.

# String multiplication
# multiple strings
name = input("name: ")
print(name * 5)

# also possible:
print("name " * 5) # will return "name name name name name "

# Multi-line strings
# multi-line strings are exactly the same as multi-line comments
# the difference is that you assign multi-line strings to a variable.

string = """There is some stuff here
            on multiple
            lines"""

strings = '''There is some stuff here
            on multiple
            lines
'''

# ESCAPE CHARACTERS
# Lets say I wanted to have an apostrophe ('s)
# Normally you'd have to be careful with the quotations you use
# If you use single quotes ('') the computer would assume you were closing the quotations.
# That's why this works below: We encase the quotes in double quotes.
string2 = f"{name}'s" # this is valid because

# However, let's assume for a second we couldn't do this.
# There's a way around this:
# You can use an escape character to avoid this issue.
string2 = f'{name}\s'
# The \ escapes the next character so that the computer ignores it's functionality if it has any.



s = "algoexpert"
contains = "a" in s
print(contains) #True

# We can convert strings to numbers but the string has to be solely numbers
s = "nineteen" # Would not work
s = "19"
q = int(s)

# however, we can check if a string is a digit with the isdigit() method.
s = "19"
is_digit = s.isdigit() #returns True

# Remember the string has to be an INTEGER. A floating point number would return False.
s = "19.6"
is_digit = s.isdigit() #returns False

# We can also check this on inputs
num = input("Integer: ")
if num.isdigit():
    print("It's a integer!")
    num = int(num)
    print(num + 10)
else:
    print("This is not an integer.")


greeting = "Hello " + name
print(greeting)
print(len(greeting))

if name in greeting:
    print("The name is contained in the greeting!")

print(f"The first character of the name is {name[0]}")


# Tuples

### What is a tuple?
Pronounced Tuple *(Cup-il)*

A tuple is a collection data type that stores a collection of elements like a list.
- A tuple is any element inside of a parentheses.
- Tuples are Immutable
```
t = (1,2,3,4)
t[2] = 10    # raises an exception because tuples cannot be changed.
t.append(10) # also raises an exception because tuples are immutable.
```

- All items are accessible using indices
```
t = (1,2,3,4)
print(t[0]) # prints 1
print([-1]) # prints 4
```

- Valid Tuple Examples:
t1 = (4, 4, 5, (3,2), True, [])
- Nested Tuples is possible


- Combining Tuples
t1 = (1, 2)
t2 = (3, 4)
combined = t1 + t2  # prints(1, 2, 3, 4)


- Multiplying Tuples
t1 = (1, 2)
multiplied = t1 * 2
print(multiplied)   # prints (1, 2, 1, 2)


- Creating Tuples
x = 1, 2, 3, 4 # A valid tuple by default
print(x)  # returns (1, 2, 3, 4)
- You don't actually need the parentheses when you define tuples.

- One Element Tuples
t1 = (1)
This won't work. It will just be an int.
If you want to make a one item tuple, you need to do this...
t1 = (1, )

- Changing a Tuple. | You can't change a Tuple but you can make a new one.
t1 = (1, 2, 3)
t2 = (t1[0], 4, t1[2])

# LISTS

### What is a list?

A list is a Data Structure. A data structure that stores a collection of data in sequential order.

Lists are 0 - indexed. What does this mean?
- Let's say we have a List called "planets_on_route_to_our_destination"

planets_on_route_to_our_destination["Jupiter", "Planet X", "hu123bfo", "Cool Planet 77"]

| Planet    | Index |
| -------- | ------- |
| Jupiter  | 0   |
| Planet X | 1     |
| hu123bfo    | 2   |
| Cool Planet 77    | 3   |


lst = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(lst[4/2]) # will return print(lst[2])


NEGATIVE INDEXING



- You can use + on lists

YES: list_one += list_two
NO: list_one = [5,4,7]
    list_one += 6
    - If we want to add a single element to a list, we need to do something like this: 
        lst = [1,2,3,4]
        lst += [5]
        # lst will be: [1,2,3,4,5]

YES:
    in_my_garden = ["tomatoes", "strawberries", "carrots", "potatoes"]
    new_in_my_garden = in_my_garden + ["apples", "lemons", "garlic", "corn"]
    # will become: ["tomatoes", "strawberries", "carrots", "potatoes", "apples", "lemons", "garlic", "corn"]



### Tuple Methods

```
tuple() ???
```

len()
count()
